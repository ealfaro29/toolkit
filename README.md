Creative Toolkit: A Universe of Mini-Apps
Creative Toolkit is a powerful, client-side collection of mini-apps designed to streamline the daily tasks of creative professionals, such as presentation designers, visual artists, and developers. Born from the need for specific, fast, and secure solutions in a high-paced environment like McKinsey's Visual Graphics, this toolkit provides a suite of tools that run entirely in your browser, ensuring your data remains private and secure.

No installations, no sign-ups, just a universe of creative power at your fingertips.

Deeper Integration: Allow apps to communicate, such as using a palette from the Color Mixer directly in the Icon Factory.

Shared Asset Library: A central place to store icons, blobs, and color palettes for reuse across projects.

Brand/Client Profiles: Save client-specific assets (logos, colors, fonts) for quick access.

New Tools: Continuously add new micro-apps that solve common design challenges.
